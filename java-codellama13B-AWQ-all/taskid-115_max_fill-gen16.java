    // and all buckets have the same capacity.
    // Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    // Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.
    // Example 1:
    // >>> maxFill((new ArrayList<ArrayList<Long>>(Arrays.asList((ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)0l, (long)1l, (long)0l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)0l, (long)1l, (long)0l, (long)0l)), (ArrayList<Long>)new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l, (long)1l))))), (1l))
