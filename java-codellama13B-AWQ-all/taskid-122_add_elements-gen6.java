class Problem {
    // Given a non-empty array array list of integers arr and an integer k, return
    // the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.
    // Example:
    // >>> addElements((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)111l, (long)21l, (long)3l, (long)4000l, (long)5l, (long)6l, (long)7l, (long)8l, (long)9l))), (4l))
    // (24l)
    // Constraints:
    // 1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100
    // 2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)
    public static long addElements(ArrayList<Long> arr, long k) {

        // Solution:
        // The trick to solve this question is to use a set to keep track of the
        // numbers with at most two digits. The set should be implemented as a TreeSet
        // to ensure that the numbers are ordered. We can then use the TreeSet's methods
        // to easily find the numbers with at most two digits and add them up.
        // This method runs in O(n) time and O(n) space.
        // The final line of code is the interesting one: it uses Stream.of() to
        // convert the set into a stream, and the .limit() method to limit the number
        // of elements in the stream to the first k elements. Finally, it uses the
        // .mapToLong() method to convert the stream into a stream of longs, and the
        // .sum() method to sum up the longs.
        Set<Long> s = new TreeSet<Long>();
        for (Long n : arr) {
            s.add(n);
        }
        return Stream.of(s).limit((long) k).mapToLong(i -> i).sum();
    }
