    // Given an array array list arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    // need to be changed to make the array array list palindromic. A palindromic array array list is an array array list that
    // is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.
    // For example:
    // >>> smallestChange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)5l, (long)4l, (long)7l, (long)9l, (long)6l))))
    // (4l)
    // >>> smallestChange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)4l, (long)3l, (long)2l, (long)2l))))
    // (1l)
    // >>> smallestChange((new ArrayList<Long>(Arrays.asList((long)1l, (long)2l, (long)3l, (long)2l, (long)1l))))
    // (0l)
