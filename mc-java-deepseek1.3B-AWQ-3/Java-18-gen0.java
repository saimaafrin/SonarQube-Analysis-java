     * 4. Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
     * 5. Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
     * 6. Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
     * 7. Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
     * In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.
     * Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
